# Acute-Myocardial-Infarction-Project

Our goal is to model hospital length of stay (LOS) for heart attack patients in New York State based on data collected from 12,844 diagnosis cases in 1993. The cases correspond to patients whose admitting diagnosis was an Acute Myocardial Infarction (AMI) and who did not have surgery, and we have been provided with information about personal details as well as the results of the stay for each of these cases. Our primary aim is to perform inferential analysis of length of stay to determine recommendations for New York hospital managers and insurance companies, but we will also incorporate predictions at various stages of this analysis to inform our recommendations.

Major topics covered include GLMs, GAMs, pruned trees, neural networks, dispersion, 1-inflatedness, missing data interpolation, feature generation, and Anova tuning.

The repository contains the code needed to recreate the figures and results presented in this project.

This project was completed in Spring 2019 with the help of Dr. Mark Glickman, Senior Lecturer in Statistics at Harvard University, with collaborators George Hu and Kay Lu.
